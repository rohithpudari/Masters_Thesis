\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}
AI-driven software development has arrived, as the introduction and successes of large language models for code, such as Copilot/Codex (Github/OpenAI) and AlphaCode (DeepMind), have shown. Above human average performance on coding challenges is now possible. However, software engineering is much more than solving programming contests. Moving beyond code completion will require an AI system that can, among other things, understand how to avoid code smells, to follow language idioms, and eventually (maybe!) propose rational software designs. We explore the current limitations these language model based tools exhibit, and offer a simple taxonomy for understanding how tools in this space can be classified.
