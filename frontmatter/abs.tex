\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

AI-supported programming has arrived, as shown by the introduction and successes of large language models for code, such as Copilot/Codex (Github/OpenAI) and AlphaCode (DeepMind). Above human average performance on programming challenges is now possible. However, software engineering is much more than solving programming contests. Moving beyond code completion to AI-supported software engineering will require an AI system that can, among other things, understand how to avoid code smells, to follow language idioms, and eventually (maybe!) propose rational software designs. We explore the current limitations these language model based tools exhibit, and offer a simple taxonomy for understanding how tools in this space can be classified.

All modern IDEs feature intelligent code completion and it is used by both new and expe- rienced software developers alike. However, there is still room for improvement in these code completion engines in terms of sorting the given completions according to the con- text of previously written code.
