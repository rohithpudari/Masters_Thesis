% I would not have finished this thesis without my professors, family, friends, and colleagues' help and support.

% First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Neil Ernst, who is always supportive and patient, provides guidance, and challenges me. I could have never been here without his countless and significant support. I also thank him for the resources and funding provided to support my work.

% I would like to thank GitHub for providing me access to Copilot. This research would not have been possible without it.

% Moreover, I thank my fellow lab members for making me feel home and motivated at workplace and for all the activities and fun we had together.
% All of this wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the equal efforts from the administrative staff of the University of Victoria and the Department of Computer Science. I thank them for all the administrative services they provided me during my M.Sc.

% I would like to thank my wonderful and perfect parents: Renuka and Srinivas, who give me endless and selfless love and always cheer me on, just as they have every step of the way. They gave me the ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights.

% Also, I take this opportunity to thank my friends outside the research lab Francis, Susan, Kealey, Anthony, and Sean. Without their support, my life in Victoria would be boring and lonely. Thank you for sticking by me.

% Thank you all.
