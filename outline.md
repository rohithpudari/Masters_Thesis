1. Introduction
	- Introduction to AI code completion tools and hint at the problems on using them.
	- research questions
		- current boundaries of code completion tools
			- Idioms
			- smells
			- structuring these boundaries.
		- how far is it from suggesting design decisions.
2. Background and Related Work
	- Code completion tools journey to Copilot.
	- alternatives to Copilot.
	- existing research papers testing Copilot.
	- Scoping the Thesis to Copilot and its current capabilities.
	- current challenges with Copilot - correctness part - obvious errors with easy fixes.
		- structuring these challenges in next chapters.
3. idioms
	- Best practices
	- Python Idioms
	- Async example of promises and callbacks.
4. Smells
	- Licence infringements
	- code review best practices
		- Security issues.
		- common errors/Bugs.
	- more specifications in input resolving these issues?
5. Framework
	- explain each stage in taxonomy and capabilities required for each stage to be completed.
	- syntax level
	- correctness
	- idioms
	- smells
	- Design - focus more on distance between smells and design. (RQ2)
		- Async examples
		- design patterns.
		- future directions to improve and get to the design level (longer term needs)
6. Discussion
	- existing tools for resolving some of the issues faced - recommendations part of ASE submission paper.
	- Limitations
	- Explainability
	- Control
7. Conclusion
