\section{Implications for practice}
	Better training data
	Clearly delineate the limitations
- Control: if you ask for a N2 algorithm it will give it to you. Should it? (Auto braking - use accelerator)
- How far should users search for the right answer? 
Recommendations to improve copilot suggestions are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item add more verified sources like documentations to training data.
    \item perform a code smell detection before every suggestion.
    \item ranking suggestions based on repository (source of suggestion) popularity.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Implications for research}
	AI for design and module level concerns - how to recapture patterns and strategies
	Example: design a system that uses Amazon SMS to parse messages of this type and stores the data in this block store after running a lambda function to restrict access
	Create a website that has customers and orders and allows new orders and customer updates using MVC
- Learn from code scans (reinforcement learning for code) 
- 
\section{Design Smells}
	Context specific issues such as variable naming conventions and formatting 
	Design smells or arch smells (Tushar Sharma) 
	Challenge is does not know the structure of the system or other files 
	
\section{Bad Practices}
    We ran an experiment with copilot to create a popular array sorting algorithm called bubble sort. Using the code suggested by copilot, it missed edge cases like empty arrays.
