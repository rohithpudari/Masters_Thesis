\subsubsection{Control}
\label{control}
Being generative models, tools like Copilot are extremely sensitive to input with stability challenges, and to make them autonomous raises control concerns.
For example, if a human asks for a N\textsuperscript{2} sorting algorithm, should Copilot recommend one or the NlogN alternative? 
Ideally, tools should warn users if prompted to suggest sub-optimal code. 
\AISE{} should learn to differentiate between optimal and sub-optimal code. 
One direction to look at is following commit histories of files, as they are the possible places to find bug fixes and performance improvements.
