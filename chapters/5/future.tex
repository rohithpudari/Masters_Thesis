However, to solve complex software engineering challenges with AI, large language models must be able to capture design and module-level concerns. 
These include recapturing design patterns (such as Observer) and architectural tactics (such as Heartbeat) to improve and personalize suggestions. 
However, the training data must also use these patterns and best practices to do this.
The vision is for something like Copilot to be capable of suggesting patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) when prompted. 
Identifying where design artifacts occur in the code, such as with pattern recovery~\cite{Keim2020}, is one avenue to explore.
