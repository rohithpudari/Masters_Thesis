\subsection{Correctness Level}
\label{correctness}
In this level, we move to the next level of abstraction, suggested code not only being syntactically correct but also solving the task. This level does not require \cct{} to suggest the optimal solution for the task but to be able to suggest any solution to a task.

For example, considering a task of perform a sorting operation on a list of numbers, to satisfy this level of abstraction, \cct{} should suggest a syntactically correct list sorting code, which is not required to to be the best algorithm to be the most efficient way. The main goal of this level in the taxonomy is for a \cct{} to be able to suggest a solution rather suggesting the best solution.

The capabilities required by a \cct{} to satisfy this level of abstraction are as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Satisfy requirements of Syntax level.
    \item Suggest a solution for a given programming task which may or may not be the optimal solution for that problem.
\end{enumerate}
