In-IDE code completion tools have improved a lot in recent years, from suggesting variables or method calls from user code bases~\cite{mandelin2005} to suggesting entire code blocks~\cite{Ciniselli2021}. The deep learning resurgence has led to strong advances in the field of \cct{}. Pre-trained large language models such as GPT-3~\cite{Gpt3}, CodeBERT~\cite{codebert}, Codex~\cite{copilot}, AlphaCode~\cite{alphacode} have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art on a code completion tasks.

Introduced in June 2021, GitHub's Copilot~\cite{Copilot-web} is an in-IDE recommender system that leverages OpenAI's Codex large language model (LLM)~\cite{copilot} which uses a GPT-3 model~\cite{Gpt3} and is then fine-tuned on code from GitHub to generate code suggestions that are uncannily effective and are able to perform above human average on programming contest problems~\cite{empirical_eval}. Copilot can generate code in a variety of languages given some context such as comments, function names, and surrounding code. Copilot is the largest and most capable such model currently available, we perform all our experiments on GitHub Copilot as a representative for \cct{}.
