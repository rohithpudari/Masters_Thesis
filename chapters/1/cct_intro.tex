Large language models such as GPT-3~\cite{Gpt3}, CodeBERT~\cite{codebert}, Codex~\cite{copilot}, AlphaCode~\cite{alphacode} have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art on a code completion tasks. 
Introduced in 2021, GitHub's Copilot~\cite{Copilot-web} is an in-IDE recommender system that leverages OpenAI's Codex large language model (LLM)~\cite{copilot} which uses a GPT-3 model~\cite{Gpt3} and is then fine-tuned on code from GitHub to generate code suggestions that are uncannily effective and are able to perform above human average on programming contest problems~\cite{empirical_eval}.
