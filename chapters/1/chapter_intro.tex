Programming is a powerful and ubiquitous problem-solving tool. Developing systems that can assist software developers or even generate programs independently could make programming more productive and accessible. 
Code completion is a feature that predicts what a software developer is trying to code and offers predictions as suggestions to the user. All modern IDEs feature intelligent code completion tools in different forms and it is used by both new and experienced software developers. Developing AI systems that can effectively model and understand code can transform these code completion tools and the way we interact with them.

Recent large-scale pre-trained language models such as \cop{}~\cite{Copilot-web} have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate code and are now able to solve programming contest style problems~\cite{empirical_eval}. 
However, software engineering is much more than writing code, it involves complex challenges like choosing the best practices, avoiding code smells, using design patterns and many more decisions before writing code. 
The scope of capabilities for \cct{} is uncertain. Identifying the nature of \cop{} capabilities when it comes to more complex challenges, i.e., \AISE{} (as opposed to development tasks, such as coding or programming problems). Delineating where \cct{} are currently best able to perform, and where more complex software engineering tasks overwhelm them is helpful in answering questions like 
Exactly which software problems can current \cct{} solve? 
If \cct{} makes a suggestion, is that suggestion accurate and optimal? Should a user intervene to correct it? But identifying these boundaries is a challenging task. In the next section, we discuss this challenge and the research opportunity that it creates as the motivation for this study.
