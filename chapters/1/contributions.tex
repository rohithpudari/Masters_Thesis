\section{Research Design and Methodology}
Code completion tools are very useful, but are often limited to the generation of single elements (e.g. method calls and properties) and the usage of templates. Furthermore, too many recommendations can decrease the usefulness of the tool~\cite{Proksch2015}. 

The current \cct{} approaches focus on programming-in-the-small \cite{DeRemer1976} i.e, on individual lines of code. 
Code language models have focused (effectively!) on source code as natural language~\cite{natural}.
This models the software development task as predicting the next token or series of tokens.
As Copilot's webpage says, the aim for Copilot is to produce ``safe and effective code [with] suggestions for whole lines or entire functions'' as ``your AI pair programmer''~\cite{Copilot-web}. 
Thus support from language models is currently focused on software \textit{programming}, rather than software \emph{engineering} (in-the-large).
