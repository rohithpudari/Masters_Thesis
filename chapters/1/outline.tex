\section{Thesis Outline}

This thesis is organized as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Chapter 2] elaborates the background information and some related work on \cct{} and GitHub Copilot. It further introduces the challenges with using \cct{} that would be explored in this thesis.
\item[Chapter 3] introduces our study on Copilot's code suggestions for code smells. It then presents the results of comparison between Copilot's code suggestions and AirBNB JavaScript coding style guide~\cite{airbnb_code}.
\item[Chapter 4] introduces our study on Copilot's code suggestions for language idioms. It then presents the results of comparison between Copilot's code suggestions and Python Language idioms from Alexandru et al.~\cite{Alexandru2018}.
\item[Chapter 5] introduces taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchy, inspired from SAE autonomous driving safety levels. It then presents set of requirements for \cct{} to satisfy each level of abstraction.
\item[Chapter 6] presents a discussion on future directions for \cct{} to reach design abstraction level in the taxonomy. It further introduces the existing tools in software engineering that can resolve some of the issues faced by using \cct{} like Copilot. We conclude by discussing the practical and research implications of this study and by identifying the limitations.
\item[Chapter 7] presents the conclusion of this research study.
