\section{Design Smells}
Currently, Copilot does not support multi-file input, So it is not possible to evaluate its design suggestions, as software development process may include multiple folders with a file structure. 
Making Code completion tools adapt their suggestions to context specific issues such as variable naming conventions and formatting would be challenging as the existing guidelines are not standard in this space and mostly depend on context, The training dataset for AI driven development should also include rules such as idioms, best practices before tackling design level problems.
