\section{Introduction}
Useful \AISE{} tools should only suggest idiomatic code, the Paradigms and Idioms level in our taxonomy.  
We leveraged the work of Alexandru et al.~\cite{Alexandru2018}, which identified community consensus on common Python programming idioms, and examined how Copilot suggested their top five idioms.


\section{Methodology}
The input to Copilot consisted of the idiom title as the first comment to provide context, as before, with minimal additional prompting. This mimics a novice user. 
% and the input was restricted to being able to go derive the ideal way from the input. This is to ensure Copilot is making the decision to suggest the good/bad way.
% We considered it a match if Copilot suggested the idiom in the first two suggestions, but note if the idiom appeared any of the top 10 suggestions currently viewable in Copilot.
