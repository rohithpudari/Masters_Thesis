\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we introduced the taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchy. We explain each software abstraction level in the taxonomy and the capabilities required by AI-supported code completion tools to satisfy the software abstraction level.
We addressed \textbf{RQ-1} (What are the current boundaries of code completion tools) using the taxonomy and the results shown in chapters~\ref{chapter:idioms} and~\ref{chapter:smells}. We show that Copilot only satisfies syntax and correctness levels in our taxonomy. 

In the next chapter~(chapter~\ref{chapter:discussion}), \textbf{RQ-2} (Given the current boundary, how far is it from suggesting design decisions?) with a discussion on the significant gap and level of complexities in creating a between code smells level and the design level in our taxonomy.
