\section{Chapter Summary}

In summary, we start this chapter by showing the methodology used in addressing \textbf{RQ-1.2} (How do \cct{} manage programming Idioms and Best Practices?). We first introduced the study setup with how the input to \cop{} was restricted and how the suggestion from \cop{} were evaluated. We sampled best practices in Python and Javascript and then compared it against \cop{} suggestions. 

Based on results shown in Table~\ref{tab:all_idioms} and \ref{tab:all_bp}, \cop{} struggles to suggest the best practices in its suggestions. In the next chapter (chapter~\ref{chapter:framework}), we illustrate our taxonomy on the hierarchy in \AISE{}, and delineate where \cct{} are currently best able to perform, and where more complex software engineering tasks overwhelm them.
