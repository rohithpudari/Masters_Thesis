\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we introduced the taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchy. We explain each software abstraction level in the taxonomy and the capabilities required by AI-supported code completion tools to satisfy each software abstraction level.
We tried to create a metric for all \cct{} to help answer \textbf{RQ-1} (What are the current boundaries of code completion tools) using the taxonomy derived from the results shown in chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}, which showed that Copilot only satisfies syntax and correctness levels in our taxonomy.

In the next chapter~(chapter~\ref{chapter:discussion}), we try to address \textbf{RQ-2} (Given the current boundary, how far is it from suggesting design decisions?) with a discussion on the significant gap and level of complexities and challenges involved in creating \cct{} at design level compared to \cct{} at code smells level in our taxonomy.
