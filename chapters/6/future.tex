\section{Future Directions}
\label{future}
To solve complex software engineering challenges with AI, machine learning models must be able to capture design and module level concerns. 
These include recapturing design patterns (such as Observer) and architectural tactics (such as Heartbeat) to improve and personalize suggestions. 
To do this, however, the training data must also use these patterns and best practices.
The vision is for something like Copilot to be capable of suggesting patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) when prompted. 
Being able to identify where design artifacts occur in the code, such as with pattern recovery~\cite{Keim2020}, is one avenue to explore.
