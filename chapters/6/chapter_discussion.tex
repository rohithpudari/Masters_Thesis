\startchapter{Discussion, Limitations \& Implications}
\label{chapter:discussion}

\section{Introduction}
In section~\ref{cs2design}, we try to address \textbf{RQ-2} (Given the current boundary, how far is it from suggesting design decisions?) with a discussion on the complex nature of design decisions involving many factors, making it difficult for \cct{} like Copilot detect the information from code files and suggest design decisions to satisfy the top abstraction level of our taxonomy.

Further, in section~\ref{evolution}, we provide a detailed discussion on how best practices change over time with an example from Asynchronous JavaScript and outline the difficulties of a \cct{} to keep updating its suggestions and reflect the current best practice.
