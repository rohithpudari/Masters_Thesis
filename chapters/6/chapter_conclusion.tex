GitHub's Copilot and related large language model approaches to code completion are promising steps in \AIDE{}. Software systems need more than development and coding effort, however. 
These systems require complex design and engineering work to build. 
We showed that while the coding syntax and correctness level of software problems is well on their way to useful AI support, the more abstract concerns, such as code smells, language idioms, and design rules, are far from solvable at present.
% The paper explored potential implications and ways to address these higher abstraction concerns. 

Although far off, we believe \AISE{}, where an AI supports designers and developers in more complex software \emph{engineering} tasks, is possible.
