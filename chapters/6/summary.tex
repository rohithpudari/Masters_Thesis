\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we addressed \textbf{RQ-2} (Given the current boundary, how far is it from suggesting design decisions?). We began with a discussion on current capabilities of Copilot and the desired capabilities of \cct{} at design abstraction level. We then observed that design evolves over time and \cct{} need to be updated often.

Furthermore, we provided implications of our study. Additionally, we recommend moving beyond token-level suggestions and using reasoning methods to make \cct{} reach the highest level of abstraction in our taxonomy~(design level).
Finally, we discussed the threats to the validity of our research and the steps taken to address those threats. We concluded by presenting the future directions of our study.
