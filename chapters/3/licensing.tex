\section{Licensing Issues}
Github Copilot\cite{copilot} is fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub. Recent work by Ciniselli et al\cite{code_clone} show that $\approx$10\% to $\approx$0.1\% of the predictions generated by a state-of-the-art DL-based code completion tools are Type-1 clones of instances in the training set, depending on the size of predicted code. Currently, There is no way for the user to determine the source of Copilot prediction (if any), which results in user being unaware of any potential copyright infringements.

We ran an experiment to determine if copilot can cause a potential copyright infringement on popular instances of code. The data we used is top code files with at-least 100 lines of code resulted on github built-in search of string "Async", a function on javascript framework. We considered a true copyright infringement when given an input of 15 lines, copilot generating at least next 25 lines of that file exactly. For example, considering a code file from 2014 \footnote{\url{https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/e5ae810dbe4ee82701c947bc4cf5425d0bedeef1/lib/async.js}}, we gave an input of first 15 lines to see if copilot would generate next lines, In this case, we were able to generate the whole file, which consisted of 974 lines (including comments and whitespaces)
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Async code file]
/* user input */
/*global setImmediate: false, setTimeout: false, console: false */
(function () {

    var async = {};

    // global on the server, window in the browser
    var root, previous_async;

    root = this;
    if (root != null) {
      previous_async = root.async;
    }

    async.noConflict = function () {
        root.async = previous_async;
/* copilot prediction */
         return async;
    };

    function only_once(fn) {
        var called = false;
        return function() {
            if (called) throw new Error("Callback was already called.");
            called = true;
            fn.apply(root, arguments);
        }
    }

    //// cross-browser compatiblity functions ////

    var _each = function (arr, iterator) {
        if (arr.forEach) {
            return arr.forEach(iterator);
        }
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
            iterator(arr[i], i, arr);
        }
    };
    .........
\end{lstlisting}
We were able to generate 48 copyright infringements out of 117 files in the experiment. This shows that there is a chance, especially in case of popular repositories and standalone scripts that are frequently repeated in similar repositories, GitHub Copilot could make a copyright violation, without any indications to the user. 
Few recommendations to reduce this error:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a code search on github before suggesting a code snippet
    \item inform user about the potential source of the code suggestion
\end{enumerate}
