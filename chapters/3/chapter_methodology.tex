\startchapter{Challenges with Copilot}
\label{chapter:methodology}

\section{Introduction}
Useful \cct{} tools should always suggest the optimal way as its first suggestion. In this chapter, we test if Copilot suggests the optimal way. 
We begin by explaining the current challenges with \cct{} like Copilot and 
We begin by explaining our approach to \textbf{RQ-1.1} (How do \cct{} manage programming idioms?). To achieve this, we conduct an exploratory study to find if \cct{} tools like Copilot suggest the optimal way in their suggestions. It is shown that Copilot's base model Codex performs best in python programming language~\cite{copilot}. So, we chose to test Copilot on python programming language idioms.

In section~\ref{methodology}, we describe our sampling approach to collecting python idioms and the evaluation method used to compare Copilot suggestions to the optimal way listed in python idioms. In section~\ref{secidioms}, we show the results of the study comparing Copilot suggestions and idioms in python programming language. We observe that Copilot performs poorly in suggesting the optimal way in its suggestions.
