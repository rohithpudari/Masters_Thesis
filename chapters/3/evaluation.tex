\section{Evaluation of Copilot suggestions}
\label{smells:evaluation}
If Copilot suggested the best practice as its first suggestion, we considered Copilot followed the coding style guide. we assume that \cct{} like Copilot are productivity tools and user should be saving time as opposed to writing the optimal way without using \cct{}, scrolling through all the suggestions to deduce the best practice that follows the coding style guide defeats this purpose. 
For this reason, We restricted ourselves to first suggestion. However, we do note if the best practice appeared any of the top 10 suggestions currently viewable in Copilot interface.
