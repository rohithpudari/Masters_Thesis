\subsection{Summary of findings}
In an attempt to find the boundaries of \cct{} like Copilot, we analyzed Copilot code suggestions for Pythonic idioms and JavaScript best practices. 
We identified that Copilot did not suggest the idiomatic way as its top suggestion for 23 out of 25 coding scenarios in Python. 
Furthermore, we identified that Copilot did not suggest the recommended best practice for 22 out of 25 coding scenarios in JavaScript.

Although Copilot is very good at solving well-specified programming contest style problems~\cite{empirical_eval}, our experiments show that it does not do well in following idioms and recommending best practices in its code suggestions.
Additionally, \cct{} like Copilot being a productivity tool, should be able to suggest idiomatic approaches and recommended best practices in its code suggestions to be helpful for the user.
Studies like ours might help use this delineation to understand what might help turn \cct{} such as Copilot into full-fledged \AISE{} tools.
