\section{Results}
\label{results}

In section~\ref{methodology}, we discussed our sources and the sampling approach for Pythonic Idioms and JavaScript coding style guide. 
We then discussed how the input for Copilot to trigger code suggestions is restricted to ensure Copilot is making the decision to suggest the desired way or vice versa.
Finally, we discussed the evaluation method used to compare Copilot's code suggestions to the idiomatic approaches and the best practices listed in coding style guide~(section~\ref{evaluation}).

In this section, we show the results of the study comparing Copilot suggestions against Pythonic idioms~(section~\ref{idioms}) addressing \textbf{RQ-1.1} (How do \cct{} manage programming idioms?) and JavaScript coding style guide~(section~\ref{smells}) addressing \textbf{RQ-1.2} (How do \cct{} manage manage to suggest non-smelly code?).
