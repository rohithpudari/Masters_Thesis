% \section{Introduction}
% Having identified the performance of current \cct{} like Copilot on detecting and suggesting common patterns like language idioms in chapter~\ref{chapter:idioms}, in this chapter we test if Copilot suggests code that follows code review standards.
% We begin by explaining our approach to \textbf{RQ-1.1} (How do \cct{} manage to write non-smelly code?). To achieve this, we conduct an exploratory study to find if \cct{} tools like Copilot suggest the best practices based on code review standards in their suggestions. 

In section~\ref{smells:methodology}, we describe our sampling approach to collecting best practices in javascript and the evaluation method used to compare Copilot suggestions to the best practices listed in coding style and code review standards. 
In section~\ref{bp}, we show the results of the study comparing Copilot suggestions and code review standards in javascript.
