Licencing - Recent work by Ciniselli et al~\cite{code_clone} show that $\approx$10\% to $\approx$0.1\% of the predictions generated by a \cct{} are Type-1 clones of instances in the training set, depending on the size of predicted code. Currently, There is no way for the user to determine the source of Copilot prediction (if any), which results in user being unaware of any potential copyright infringements
