\section{Input to Copilot}
\label{input}
The input to Copilot consisted of the idiom title in the first line as a comment to provide context, and the input was restricted to being able to derive the ideal way~(idiomatic way) from the input. This is done to ensure Copilot is making the decision to suggest the good/bad way in its suggestions and not being restricted by the input to suggest a certain way. 

This input style also mimics a novice user, who is unaware of the idioms and useful \cct{} should drive the novice user to use idiomatic ways to perform a task in their codebases.
