\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we first provided some background on different language models used for \cct{} and their limitations. We reviewed early developments in \cct{} with statistical language models like N-grams. Followed by a discussion on N-gram based \cct{} and the limitations of statistical language models, resulting in using neural language models for \cct{}. We established the importance of transformers for \cct{} which is a crucial component of OpenAI's Codex Model~\cite{copilot}. To further explore the role of transformer architecture in \cct{}, we reviewed studies showing context-sensitive contextualised word representations were presented by LMs such BERT~\cite{bert}.

We then discussed GitHub Copilot, the \cct{} we would use as the basis for our study in this thesis. Additionally, we reviewed the key functionalities of Copilot.
Furthermore, we discussed some of the related works on Copilot about its usage~\cite{Vaithilingam2022} and its effectiveness in solving programming contest style problems~\cite{empirical_eval}. We concluded by introducing some of the other \cct{} that provide similar functionality like Copilot.

In the next chapters, we discuss the problems with using \cct{} like Copilot that are harder to fix and straight-forward corrections may not exist, like language idioms and code smells. 
We try to address \textbf{RQ-1} (What are the current boundaries of code completion tools) using the methodology and present our results~(Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}).
We then introduce a taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchy to help with finding the current boundaries of \cct{} like Copilot (Chapter~\ref{chapter:framework}). To address \textbf{RQ-2} (Given the current boundary, how far is it from suggesting design decisions?), we discuss the complex nature of design decisions, and the challenges with trying to use \cct{} to make design decisions.
Finally, we discuss some of the practical implications, limitations of our findings and also provide some future directions to help further research in \cct{} (Chapter~\ref{chapter:discussion}).
